# BUYSELL WhatsApp Listing Collector (Render 24/7 Deployment)

This repository contains the standalone, cloud-ready WhatsApp Collector worker for **BUYSELL Nigeria**. It monitors approved WhatsApp groups in real time, uses Groq AI (Llama 3.3 70B) to parse commercial sale posts, uploads attached photos and videos to Cloudinary, and automatically imports listings into BUYSELL Supabase tables.

### Step 3: Link Your WhatsApp Account via Render Logs

1. Click **Deploy Web Service**.
2. Once the build finishes, open the **Logs** tab on Render.
3. Because you provided `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER`, you will see:
   ```text
   ============================================================
   YOUR WHATSAPP PAIRING CODE: ABCD-1234
   ============================================================
   ```
4. On your phone:
   - Open WhatsApp → **Settings** (or 3 dots) → **Linked Devices**.
   - Tap **"Link a device"**.
   - Tap **"Link with phone number instead"** at the bottom.
   - Enter the 8-character code shown in your Render logs.
5. As soon as linked, your Render service logs will show:
   ```text
   [Groups] Monitoring approved WhatsApp groups.
   BUYSELL WhatsApp collector is monitoring approved groups.
   ```

## Health Check Endpoint
The service starts a lightweight HTTP server on `PORT` responding with `200 OK` at `/`, ensuring Render's health checks pass and keep the worker running continuously.

---

## Approved Groups Management
Group IDs are managed from the BUYSELL Super Admin portal (**Super Admin** → **WhatsApp**). The cloud collector refreshes the allow-list automatically every 60 seconds without requiring a redeployment or restart.
